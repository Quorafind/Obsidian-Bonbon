# Bonbon

A plugin for Obsidian, based on Boninall's workflow.

[中文文档](README_CN.md)

Over time, I have had many small ideas for improving Obsidian. Sometimes these ideas are too small to warrant publishing as standalone plugins, but I still frequently need these minor improvements.

So, I decided to integrate these small improvements into one plugin, and that's what Bonbon is.

In my imagination, Bonbon will have a lot of candy-level small features.

## File Explorer

- Supports searching within selected folders. Right-click a folder and select "Search in selected folder" to search within it.
- Supports searching within selected files. Right-click a file and select "Search in selected file" to search within it.
- Supports folder task status marking (Adding `- [ ] folder name` in the root TODO.md file will mark that folder as a TODO)
- Supports total character count/daily character count in the status bar.

## Callout

- Add a dropdown to the callout icon to change the callout type.
